                   networks (CNNs) has seen huge adoption in computer vision
                   applications. Comparatively, unsupervised learning with CNNs
                   has received less attention. In this work we hope to help
                   bridge the gap between the success of CNNs for supervised

                   networks (DCGANs), that have certain architectural
                   constraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong
                   candidate for unsupervised learning. Training on various
                   image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep

  abstract = "Is perception of the whole based on perception of its parts?
              There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based
              representations in the brain, and certain computational theories
              of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is
              known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of
              objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix
              factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic
              features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as
              principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn
              holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix
              factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use
              of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a
              parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not
              subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization
              is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations
              emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons
              are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.",

               multimedia data. But exactly how such data can be harnessed and
               organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new
               database called ``ImageNet'', a large-scale ontology of images
               built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims
               to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with
               an average of 500--1000 clean and full resolution images. This
               will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by
               the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed
               analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247

              recognition is proposed in this paper. The network is
              self-organized by ``learning without a teacher'', and acquires an
              ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical
              similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their
              positions. This network is given a nickname ``neocognitron''.
              After completion of self-organization, the network has a
              structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous
              system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consists of an
              input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade
              connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is
              composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first
              layer of each module consists of ``S-cells'', which show
              characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order
              hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists of ``C-cells''
              similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The
              afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are
              modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning:
              We do not need any ``teacher'' during the process of
              self-organization, and it is only needed to present a set of
              stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network.
              The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After
              repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each
              stimulus pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of
              the C-cells of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has
              become selectively responsive only to that stimulus pattern. That
              is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than
              one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last
              layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither
              is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the
              stimulus pattern.",

  abstract = "Social networking platforms have become an essential means for
              communicating feelings to the entire world due to rapid expansion

              pictures, audio, and video to express their feelings or
              viewpoints. Text communication via Web-based networking media, on
              the other hand, is somewhat overwhelming. Every second, a massive
              amount of unstructured data is generated on the Internet due to
              social media platforms. The data must be processed as rapidly as
              generated to comprehend human psychology, and it can be
              accomplished using sentiment analysis, which recognizes polarity
              in texts. It assesses whether the author has a negative,
              positive, or neutral attitude toward an item, administration,
              individual, or location. In some applications, sentiment analysis
              is insufficient and hence requires emotion detection, which
              determines an individual's emotional/mental state precisely. This
              review paper provides understanding into levels of sentiment
              analysis, various emotion models, and the process of sentiment
              analysis and emotion detection from text. Finally, this paper

  abstract = "With the rapid proliferation of social networking sites (SNS),
              automatic topic extraction from various text messages posted on
              SNS are becoming an important source of information for
              understanding current social trends or needs. Latent Dirichlet
              Allocation (LDA), a probabilistic generative model, is one of the
              popular topic models in the area of Natural Language Processing
              (NLP) and has been widely used in information retrieval, topic
              extraction, and document analysis. Unlike long texts from formal
              documents, messages on SNS are generally short. Traditional topic
              models such as LDA or pLSA (probabilistic latent semantic
              analysis) suffer performance degradation for short-text analysis
              due to a lack of word co-occurrence information in each short
              text. To cope with this problem, various techniques are evolving
              for interpretable topic modeling for short texts, pretrained word
              embedding with an external corpus combined with topic models is
              one of them. Due to recent developments of deep neural networks
              (DNN) and deep generative models, neural-topic models (NTM) are
              emerging to achieve flexibility and high performance in topic
              modeling. However, there are very few research works on
              neural-topic models with pretrained word embedding for generating
              high-quality topics from short texts. In this work, in addition
              to pretrained word embedding, a fine-tuning stage with an
              original corpus is proposed for training neural-topic models in
              order to generate semantically coherent, corpus-specific topics.
              An extensive study with eight neural-topic models has been
              completed to check the effectiveness of additional fine-tuning
              and pretrained word embedding in generating interpretable topics
              by simulation experiments with several benchmark datasets. The
              extracted topics are evaluated by different metrics of topic
              coherence and topic diversity. We have also studied the
              performance of the models in classification and clustering tasks.
              Our study concludes that though auxiliary word embedding with a
              large external corpus improves the topic coherency of short
              texts, an additional fine-tuning stage is needed for generating
              more corpus-specific topics from short-text data.",

                   autoencoders have obtained increasingly research interest
                   due to their promising results on text analysis. However, it
                   is usually hard for existing NTMs to achieve good document
                   representation and coherent/diverse topics at the same time.
                   Moreover, they often degrade their performance severely on
                   short documents. The requirement of reparameterisation could
                   also comprise their training quality and model flexibility.
                   To address these shortcomings, we present a new neural topic
                   model via the theory of optimal transport (OT).
                   Specifically, we propose to learn the topic distribution of
                   a document by directly minimising its OT distance to the
                   document's word distributions. Importantly, the cost matrix
                   of the OT distance models the weights between topics and
                   words, which is constructed by the distances between topics
                   and words in an embedding space. Our proposed model can be
                   trained efficiently with a differentiable loss. Extensive
                   experiments show that our framework significantly
                   outperforms the state-of-the-art NTMs on discovering more

               Popular models that learn such representations ignore the
               morphology of words, by assigning a distinct vector to each
               word. This is a limitation, especially for languages with large
               vocabularies and many rare words. In this paper, we propose a
               new approach based on the skipgram model, where each word is
               represented as a bag of character n-grams. A vector
               representation is associated to each character n-gram; words
               being represented as the sum of these representations. Our
               method is fast, allowing to train models on large corpora
               quickly and allows us to compute word representations for words

               representations on nine different languages, both on word

               change to the topic model requires mathematically deriving a new
               inference algorithm. A promising approach to address this
               problem is autoencoding variational Bayes (AEVB), but it has
               proven difficult to apply to topic models in practice. We
               present what is to our knowledge the first effective AEVB based
               inference method for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), which we
               call Autoencoded Variational Inference For Topic Model (AVITM).
               This model tackles the problems caused for AEVB by the Dirichlet
               prior and by component collapsing. We find that AVITM matches
               traditional methods in accuracy with much better inference time.
               Indeed, because of the inference network, we find that it is
               unnecessary to pay the computational cost of running variational
               optimization on test data. Because AVITM is black box, it is
               readily applied to new topic models. As a dramatic illustration
               of this, we present a new topic model called ProdLDA, that
               replaces the mixture model in LDA with a product of experts. By
               changing only one line of code from LDA, we find that ProdLDA
